Spring Boot Dockerized Project Readme
This is a sample Spring Boot project that demonstrates how to containerize a Spring Boot application using Docker. Docker allows you to package your application along with its dependencies into a single container, making it easier to deploy and manage in various environments.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

Docker: Install Docker
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher: Install JDK
Spring Boot: Spring Boot Installation Guide
Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the Spring Boot application in a Docker container:

Clone the repository:

shell
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spring-boot-dockerized.git
Navigate to the project directory:

shell
Copy code
cd spring-boot-dockerized
Build the Spring Boot application using Maven or Gradle:

For Maven:

shell
Copy code
mvn clean package
For Gradle:

shell
Copy code
./gradlew clean build
Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:

shell
Copy code
docker build -t spring-boot-dockerized .
Run the Docker container:

shell
Copy code
docker run -p 8080:8080 spring-boot-dockerized
This command maps port 8080 in the container to port 8080 on your host machine.

Access the Spring Boot application in your web browser or using a tool like curl:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:8080
You should see a "Hello, Spring Boot!" message if the application is running successfully.

Configuration
You can customize the application's configuration by modifying the application.properties or application.yml files in the src/main/resources directory.

Docker Configuration
The Docker configuration for this project is defined in the Dockerfile. You can modify it to suit your specific requirements, such as adding environment variables or adjusting container settings.
